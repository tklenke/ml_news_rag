----QUESTIONS-----
Question 0: How much angle should I have for the control stick to allow for sufficient clearance?
Question 1: Give me a list of engines that I should consider.  Include two sentences of pros and cons for each.
Question 2: Give me a list of tips to consider when installing the engine.
------PROMPT------
You are an aerospace engineer specializing in amatuer-built aircraft. Don't restate this. If you don't know the answer, 
    just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer. 
-----ANSWERS------

Model: all-minilm

  A0: ----------
Based on the provided context, it appears that there is a change in the control stick attachment angle from 10° to 15° (Chap.16, p.2). Therefore, I would recommend an angle of 15° for the control stick to allow for sufficient clearance between the stick and the fuselage side.

  A1: ----------
Here are some engine options for amateur-built aircraft, along with pros and cons for each:

1. Lycoming O-235 series:
Pros: This is a well-established and reliable choice, with a proven track record in homebuilt aircraft.
Cons: It may be heavier than other options, which could affect the overall performance of the aircraft.

2. Continental O-200 series:
Pros: This engine is known for its strong performance and reliability, making it a popular choice among homebuilders.
Cons: It may require more maintenance than some other options, as it has more complex systems.

3. Rotax 912 series:
Pros: This engine is lightweight and compact, making it ideal for smaller aircraft. It's also relatively fuel-efficient.
Cons: Some builders have reported issues with the engine's power output at higher altitudes.

4. Great American Propeller:
Pros: This propeller is designed to provide better takeoff and climb performance without sacrificing top-end speed.
Cons: As mentioned earlier, this propeller has not been extensively tested in a Cozy aircraft.

5. Lycoming O-320 series:
Pros: This engine provides more power than the O-235 series, which can be beneficial for those who want to carry heavier loads or fly at higher altitudes.
Cons: It may be heavier and more expensive than some other options, and it requires more maintenance than some builders may prefer.

Remember that each builder's experience with these engines may vary, and it's essential to research and test each option thoroughly before making a decision.

  A2: ----------
Here are the tips to consider when installing the engine:

1. Follow the instructions in Chapter 23 of Section IA carefully.
2. Consider using a used engine instead of a new one, as ground running can be hard on a new engine and it's not the best way to break it in.

For larger engines (beyond the approved Lycoming 0-235 series), consider the following:

* The extra power may not be worth the additional weight and fuel consumption.
* Other engines might be cheaper upfront, but they may cost more to operate in the long run.
* If you're considering a different engine, make sure it's a well-regarded choice that won't attract unwanted attention or criticism.

In general:

* Keep your airplane light and clean to maximize performance. Avoid adding unnecessary weight or complexity.
* Use lightweight components and designs wherever possible.
* Be prepared for the possibility of failure when testing and evaluating an experimental engine installation.
* Don't use an experimental aircraft as a testbed for an experimental engine - it's better to use a dedicated, easily recoverable aircraft instead.

Remember to always follow safety guidelines and best practices when working on your amateur-built aircraft.

Model: bge-m3

  A0: ----------
Based on the provided context, it seems that the recommended angle for the control stick is between 10° and 15°, as mentioned in Chap. 16, p.2. This suggests that a more pronounced angle would provide sufficient clearance for full aileron travel when your hand is on the stick.

  A1: ----------
Based on the provided context, here are some larger engines you should consider for your amateur-built aircraft:

**Lycoming O-235 series (L2C) with mechanical fuel pump**

Pros: The approved engine for amateur-built aircraft, reliable and well-established.
Cons: Heavier than other options, may require additional structural reinforcement to accommodate the increased weight.

**Other non-aircraft engines**

Pros: May be cheaper or more available than traditional aviation engines.
Cons: Experimental nature means they may not be well-suited for amateur-built aircraft use, potentially leading to issues with reliability, performance, and maintenance. Additionally, using an experimental engine in a amateur-built aircraft could attract unwanted attention from regulators.

It's essential to note that the O-235 series is considered the optimum choice for amateur-built aircraft, and any alternative engines should be carefully evaluated for their suitability and potential impact on your aircraft's performance and safety.

Keep in mind that adding horsepower through larger engines may not necessarily result in improved performance or efficiency. The provided context highlights the importance of considering factors such as takeoff distance, climb rate, and approach speeds when selecting an engine for your amateur-built aircraft.

  A2: ----------
Here are some tips to consider when installing the engine:

1. **Carefully measure and align the engine**: Make sure the crankshaft center line is right on B.L. 0 looking down at a plan view, with no side-to-side offset. In a side view, the engine should be mounted with both forward and aft tubes square and true.

2. **Consider down thrust**: Ensure the prop flange is higher than the magneto end of the engine by approximately 2 degrees (plus or minus 1 degree will be okay). This can affect performance and efficiency.

3. **Verify engine mount installation**: When installing the engine mount, do not assume the four forward tubes are square and true. Clamp the mount to the aluminum extrusions and measure from the firewall back to the flanges (conical mount) or to the donuts (dynafocal).

4. **Plan for fuel system installation**: Consider the mechanical fuel pump preferred by Burt Rutan.

5. **Choose the right engine**: The approved engine is the Lycoming 0-235 series, specifically the model L2C with mechanical fuel pump preferred. This is the same engine that has been demonstrated and considered optimum.

6. **Be mindful of weight distribution**: Ensure proper weight distribution in your aircraft to avoid any potential issues during flight.

7. **Verify pitot installation**: Make sure to install the pitot before flying, as it provides essential data for the instruments. Consider using a foolproof system like hanging the pitot on your ignition switch to remind you to install it.

8. **Don't cut holes in the panel too early**: Wait until all other work is complete and you have purchased any necessary components before cutting holes in the panel.

9. **Consider larger engines (with caution)**: Larger engines, such as the 0-235 series without starter, are approved by Burt Rutan for this aircraft. However, keep in mind that installing a larger engine requires careful consideration of its impact on performance and stability.

10. **Verify the centerline**: Ensure that the centerline of the engine is aligned with the centerline of the wing during installation to prevent any potential issues during flight.

Based on the context, it seems that you're looking to install the control stick with sufficient clearance. According to the plans changes, the recommended angle of stick attachment has been increased from 2° to 3-4° to ensure enough clearance for full aileron travel when your hand is on the stick.

To achieve this, I would recommend carving a depression in the fuselage side all the way through the 3/8" foam, so that the inside and outside skins meet. This will provide the necessary clearance without affecting the overall structure of the aircraft. Additionally, you can put a 5° bend in the aluminum stick extension if needed.

So, to answer your question directly: I would recommend aiming for an angle of 3-4° when installing the control stick to ensure sufficient clearance and full aileron travel.

  A1: ----------
Here are some engines you should consider for your amateur-built aircraft:

**Lycoming O-235**: This is an approved engine for the Cozy, and the one we demonstrated. It's the heaviest engine installation approved by Burt Rutan. Pros: It's a reliable and well-established engine option. Cons: It's heavy and may require additional structural support in your aircraft.

**Continental C90-12F**: This engine is another option for those who want to stay with a 0-235 series engine. Pros: It offers more power than the O-235, but still has a similar weight and installation requirements. Cons: It's less established as an approved engine for the Cozy.

**Rotax 912S**: This engine is known for its efficiency and reliability. Pros: It's lighter and smaller than the O-235 series engines, making it a great option for those who want to optimize their aircraft's performance. Cons: It may not have the same power output as the O-235 series engines.

**Other non-approved engines**: Keep in mind that using a non-approved engine can be risky and may not provide the best overall performance or safety. Pros: They may offer more power or better fuel efficiency than approved engines. Cons: They may require additional modifications to your aircraft, and may not meet all of the safety standards.

I hope this helps you make an informed decision about which engine is right for your amateur-built aircraft!

  A2: ----------
Here are some tips to consider when installing the engine:

1. **Carefully follow Chapter 23 of Section IA**, which should provide detailed instructions for the engine installation.
2. **Make sure you understand the engine alignment requirements**: The crankshaft centerline should be right on B.L. 0 looking down at a plan view, with no side-to-side offset.
3. **Consider using a used engine** instead of a new one, as it may be cheaper and more suitable for a homebuilt aircraft like the Cozy.
4. **Be mindful of the engine mount design**: The engine mount was designed some time ago, so make sure you understand its requirements and any potential limitations.
5. **Don't rush the process**: Engine and cowling installation are partly covered in previous chapters, so take your time to ensure a proper installation.
6. **Check for condensation issues**: Silicone the top cover back on the soda straw flush with the bottom of the recess to prevent corrosion of the wing bolts.

Remember that engine installation is a critical part of the Cozy's construction process. Take your time, follow the instructions carefully, and consult with experts if you have any questions or concerns.

A great question!

For a amateur-built aircraft, the recommended angle of the control stick to ensure sufficient clearance depends on several factors, including the design and size of the instrument panel, the type of instruments installed, and personal preference.

Typically, a good starting point is to aim for an angle between 20° to 30° from the horizontal. This allows for easy access to the instruments while still providing a comfortable grip for the pilot. However, this may need to be adjusted based on the specific design of your aircraft.

If you're looking for more precise guidance, I recommend consulting the recommendations provided by organizations such as the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) or the Light Plane Manufacturers Association (LPA). They provide detailed guidelines and specifications for amateur-built aircraft designs.

As an aerospace engineer specializing in amateur-built aircraft, I'd be happy to provide some valuable tips for installing an engine:

1. **Plan ahead**: Before starting the installation process, ensure you have all the necessary components, tools, and documentation (e.g., manuals, diagrams) readily available.

2. **Choose the right mounting configuration**: Select a mounting arrangement that suits your aircraft's design and provides adequate clearance for maintenance access. Consult with the engine manufacturer or consult relevant data sheets to determine the recommended mounting configuration.

3. **Verify firewall forward clearance**: Ensure the engine installation doesn't compromise firewall-forward clearance, which is crucial for maintaining safe operation and reducing risk of fire hazards.

4. **Consider electrical system integration**: Plan for integrating the engine's electrical systems (e.g., ignition, starter) with your aircraft's existing electrical infrastructure to ensure a smooth and reliable installation.

5. **Don't overlook airflow management**: Pay attention to airflow around the installed engine to prevent overheating or interference with surrounding components. Consult data sheets or consult with experts if unsure about airflow considerations.

6. **Secure fasteners properly**: Ensure all bolts, nuts, and screws are securely tightened according to manufacturer recommendations and applicable regulations (e.g., FAA).

7. **Maintain proper oil drainage**: Ensure the installed engine has adequate oil drainage provisions to prevent contamination of critical components or aircraft systems.

8. **Verify propeller installation considerations**: If your aircraft is equipped with a propeller, ensure you follow recommended installation procedures to avoid vibration, noise, or performance issues.

9. **Conduct thorough pre-flight checks**: Before conducting the first flight after engine installation, perform a comprehensive inspection and testing to verify all systems are functioning correctly and safely.

10. **Document the process**: Keep detailed records of your engine installation process for future reference and compliance with regulatory requirements (e.g., FAA).

Remember to consult relevant regulations, manufacturer guidelines, and industry experts if you're unsure about any aspect of the engine installation process.
