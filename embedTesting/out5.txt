5. Great American 62"x62":
	* Pros: Relatively affordable, offers decent performance, and suitable for most general aviation purposes.
	* Cons: May not be the best choice for high-altitude or high-performance operations, and potential for higher fuel consumption.

Keep in mind that each of these engines has its unique characteristics, advantages, and limitations. It's essential to consider your specific flying needs, operating conditions, and maintenance preferences when choosing an engine. Additionally, always follow proper installation and maintenance procedures to ensure the safety and reliability of your aircraft.

  A2: ----------
Based on the provided context, here are some tips to consider when installing the engine:

1. **Refer to Chapter 23 of Section IA** for detailed instructions on engine installation.
2. **Verify clearance**: Ensure you have enough clearance between the engine and cowling by either deforming the cowling with heat or adding a small blister locally if needed.
3. **Fabricate the engine mount carefully**: The engine mount structure can be tricky to build from a drawing, so take your time and ensure it fits properly.
4. **Choose the approved engine**: The Lycoming 0-235 series (L2C with mechanical fuel pump preferred) is the approved engine for the Cozy, and it's considered optimum.
5. **Consider the weight and power trade-offs**: Larger engines may offer more power, but they also increase weight and require more fuel, which can offset any benefits.
6. **Be mindful of center of gravity (c.g.)**: Ensure you don't exceed the aft c.g. limit of 102 to minimize drag and maintain stability.
7. **Choose the right propeller**: Select a propeller based on your expected flying conditions, such as short-field or high-density airport operations.
8. **Verify compatibility with other systems**: Ensure that the engine installation does not interfere with other critical systems, such as electrical or finishing components.

Remember to consult the plans and chapter 15 (Firewall) for more detailed information on engine installation.

Model: bge-m3

  A0: ----------
According to Chap. 16, p.2, the recommended angle for the control stick is 15°.

  A1: ----------
Here are some larger engines that you may consider:

1. **Lycoming O-320 series**: As mentioned in the text, this is a heavier engine option that can provide more power for takeoff and climb. Pros: More power available for takeoff and climb. Cons: Heavier weight requires faster approach speeds, more frequent fuel stops, and higher operating costs.
2. **Continental IO-360 series**: Another heavier engine option that provides more power for takeoff and climb. Pros: Similar to the O-320, this engine offers more power for takeoff and climb. Cons: Same concerns as with the O-320 regarding weight, approach speeds, fuel stops, and operating costs.
3. **Piper PA-30 Twin Comanche's Continental IO-520 series**: This is a higher-horsepower engine that can provide even more power for takeoff and climb. Pros: Even more power available for takeoff and climb. Cons: Heavier weight requires even faster approach speeds, more frequent fuel stops, and even higher operating costs.

Keep in mind that these engines are heavier and require more maintenance than the approved Lycoming O-235 series engine. Additionally, as mentioned in the text, it's important to carefully consider the trade-offs between power and weight when selecting an engine for your amateur-built aircraft.

  A2: ----------
Here are some tips to consider when installing the engine:

1. **Plan ahead**: Make sure you have all the necessary components and materials before starting the installation process.
2. **Follow a logical sequence**: Don't try to install the engine without having built the wings, centerspar, and gear first. It's better to start with the wings and work your way up.
3. **Seal those gas tanks**: A well-sealed fiberglass tank can be a real joy, but a leaky one can be a real pain (learned the hard way). Pay attention to corners and joints, and use a squeegee to force epoxy into any pinholes.
4. **Test your tanks before finishing**: Hook up the vent line and test the tanks before applying a finish coat. This will help identify any issues early on.
5. **Don't rush it**: Take your time when installing the engine. Rushing can lead to mistakes, which can be costly (and frustrating).
6. **Consult the plans and manuals**: Make sure you understand each step of the installation process before proceeding. Don't rely solely on intuition or guesswork.

Remember, building an amateur-built aircraft requires patience, attention to detail, and a willingness to learn from mistakes.

Based on the provided context, it seems that the control stick should have an angle to allow for sufficient clearance. This is important because of the down thrust design, where the prop flange is higher than the magneto end of the engine.

According to Chapter 5, p.3, Fig.7, Sec D-D, the recommended angle for the control stick is not explicitly stated. However, it does mention that you should not neglect to set the gear when you park, which implies that there might be a specific clearance requirement to avoid damage or interference with the propeller.

Considering the down thrust design and the potential for excessive prop wash, I would recommend an angle of around 1-2 degrees (plus or minus 1 degree) to ensure sufficient clearance between the control stick and the prop flange. This is just an educated guess, as the exact recommended angle is not provided in the context.

Based on my expertise as an aerospace engineer specializing in amateur-built aircraft, here are some engine options you should consider for your Cozy:

1. **Lycoming O-235**: This is a popular choice for amateur-built aircraft, known for its reliability and fuel efficiency. Pros: well-established manufacturer, wide availability of parts and maintenance services; Cons: more expensive than other options, may require additional modifications to fit the Cozy's engine mount structure.
2. **Continental IO-240**: This engine offers more power than the O-235 while still being a popular choice for amateur-built aircraft. Pros: similar pros to the O-235, with the added benefit of increased power; Cons: slightly heavier and more expensive than the O-235.
3. **Briggs & Stratton 5G7**: This engine is designed specifically for lighter-than-air aircraft, but its compact size and light weight make it a viable option for amateur-built aircraft like the Cozy. Pros: very lightweight and compact, relatively inexpensive; Cons: may require additional modifications to fit the Cozy's engine mount structure.
4. **Rotax 912**: This is a popular choice for light-sport aircraft (LSA) and can be adapted for use in amateur-built aircraft like the Cozy. Pros: well-established manufacturer with a reputation for reliability, wide availability of parts and maintenance services; Cons: more expensive than other options, may require additional modifications to fit the Cozy's engine mount structure.

When considering these engines, keep in mind that you should prioritize factors like fuel efficiency, power-to-weight ratio, and overall cost of ownership. Additionally, be sure to research any potential modifications or upgrades required to ensure compatibility with the Cozy's design.

  A2: ----------
Based on the provided context and installation instructions, here are some tips to consider when installing the engine:

1. **Mount the engine correctly**: Ensure that the crankshaft centerline is aligned with BL 0 looking down at a plan view. There should be no side-to-side offset.
2. **Consider the down thrust angle**: Ideally, the prop flange should be higher than the magneto end of the engine by about 2 degrees. Plus or minus 1 degree will be acceptable.
3. **Position the engine mount correctly**: When installing the engine mount, do not assume that the four forward tubes are square and true. Clamp the mount to the aluminum extrusions and measure from the firewall back to the flanges (conical mount) or to the donuts (dynafocal). Do not drill in the mount until it is positioned correctly.
4. **Check prop bolt circle**: If you're using a standard Brock prop extension with threaded bolts, ensure that you order the correct bolt circle to fit your engine from Ken Brock Mfg.

Additional tips and hints mentioned in the newsletter:

1. **Seal your gas tanks well**: A well-sealed fiberglass tank can be a joy; a leaky one can be a pain.
2. **Test your tanks before finishing**: Hook up the vent line and test the tanks before installing the centerspar and gear.
3. **Install the turtleback and canopy before building strakes**: Some builders may prefer to do this, but it's not strictly necessary.
4. **Don't cut holes in your panel until everything else is done**: Make a mock panel first to decide on instrument and radio arrangements.
5. **Consider using a used engine**: A used engine can be cheaper and preferable for ground running and testing.

Please note that these tips are based on the provided context and may not cover all aspects of engine installation.

Based on the context you provided, it seems that the control stick should have an angle of approximately 2 degrees to allow for sufficient clearance. This is because the prop flange is higher than the magneto end of the engine, and ideally, this angle would be maintained when installing the control stick.

  A1: ----------
Based on your context, I'll provide you with a list of engines to consider for your amateur-built aircraft, along with their pros and cons:

1. Lycoming O-235 series:
	* Pros: Proven track record in the Long-EZ and Varieze, reliable, and easy to maintain.
	* Cons: May not be the most powerful option, but provides a good balance between power and weight.
2. Lycoming 0-320 series (unapproved for COZY):
	* Pros: More powerful than the O-235, potentially more efficient at high altitudes.
	* Cons: Unapproved by RAF for use in the COZY due to concerns about mounting system, weight, CG, landing speed, and crash survivability.

Note that the 0-320 series is not approved for use in the COZY, so you would need to consider other options if you want a similar power output. The Lycoming O-235 series remains a reliable and well-tested choice for amateur-built aircraft like the COZY.

Keep in mind that when considering engine options, it's essential to think about the trade-offs between power, weight, and efficiency. A more powerful engine may not always be the best option, as it can also increase fuel consumption and require more maintenance.

  A2: ----------
Here are some tips to consider when installing the engine:

1. **Check the alignment**: Make sure the crankshaft center line is right on BL 0 looking down at a plan view, with no side-to-side offset.
2. **Mount the engine mount correctly**: Don't assume the four forward tubes are square and true. Clamp the mount to the aluminum extrusions and measure from the firewall back to the flanges (conical mount) or to the donuts (dynafocal). Only drill in the mount after it's positioned correctly.
3. **Consider the down thrust**: Ideally, the prop flange should be higher than the magneto end of the engine by 2 degrees (plus or minus 1 degree is okay).
4. **Install the prop bolts carefully**: If using a standard Brock prop extension with threaded hubs, install them before building the centerspar and gear.
5. **Take care when handling the engine mount**: Engine mounts can be tricky to build from drawings, so it's essential to get it right the first time.

Remember to follow the instructions in Chapter 23 of Section IA for a detailed guide on installing the engine.

Here are some tips to consider when installing the engine:

* Make sure you have a thorough understanding of the installation process before starting. Don't expect to understand everything perfectly on the first reading, particularly if you're just receiving your plans.
* Check your plans for any errors or omissions before beginning construction. We've made mistakes in the past, but we try to catch them and correct them as quickly as possible.
* Be mindful of the trimming dimensions provided in the plans. The side windows, for example, required some adjustments to get them right.
* Consider using molds to simplify the process of creating complex shapes like the turtleback or canopy.
* Don't assume that just because a change seems minor, it won't have an impact on performance and safety factor. Be prepared to conduct thorough tests to ensure your changes don't compromise the integrity of the design.
* When making changes to the design, be aware that you are taking on the responsibility of both designer and manufacturer. This means you'll need to thoroughly test any modifications you make to ensure they're safe and effective.

Note: These tips assume you have already received the plans and have a basic understanding of how things are done. The engine installation instructions can be found in Chapter 23 of Section IA, which may cover some of these points in more detail.

Based on the provided context, it seems that you are asking about the angle for the control stick to allow for sufficient clearance.

The text mentions installing the control stick bolt at the bottom of the fork with a 10° to 15° angle. It also recommends carving a depression in the fuselage side all the way through the 3/8" foam, so the inside and outside skins meet. This would ensure that the control stick has sufficient clearance.

Therefore, I would recommend an angle of around 12.5° (midpoint of the 10° to 15° range) for the control stick bolt installation, taking into account the fork and fuselage design.

Here are some tips to consider when installing the engine:

1. **Pay attention to down thrust**: Make sure the prop flange is higher than the magneto end of the engine by about 2 degrees (plus or minus 1 degree). This will affect how your propeller functions.
2. **Measure and position the engine mount correctly**: Don't assume the forward tubes are square and true. Measure from the firewall back to the flanges (conical mount) or to the donuts (dynafocal), and only drill into the mount once it's properly positioned.
3. **Adjust for clearance**: If you don't have enough clearance between the engine and cowling, consider deforming the cowling with heat or adding a small blister locally.
4. **Consider using a standard Brock prop extension**: This can help fit around the O-235 engine we've demonstrated.
5. **Be prepared to spend extra time on the engine mount**: Ken Brock is fabricating an approved dynafocal mount, but even with experience, it's tricky to get right.

Remember to refer to Chapter 23 of Section IA for more detailed instructions on engine installation.

For amateur-built aircraft, the recommended angle for the control stick to ensure sufficient clearance is typically around 3-5 degrees of neutral pitch and 10-15 degrees of roll. However, this can vary depending on the specific design and layout of your aircraft.

It's also important to consider the type of flight you'll be doing, as well as any potential hazards or obstacles that may affect control stick clearance during flight. For example, if you'll be flying in tight spaces or at high angles of attack, you may want to err on the side of caution and adjust the control stick angle accordingly.

In general, a good rule of thumb is to provide enough clearance to avoid any binding or interference with the stick, while still maintaining positive control authority.

As an aerospace engineer specializing in amateur-built aircraft, I've worked with numerous builders on various projects. When it comes to installing an engine, here are some key considerations:

1. **Choose the right mount**: Select an engine mount that's specifically designed for your specific aircraft and engine combination. Make sure it can withstand the stresses of flight and provides proper clearance for other components.

2. **Verify alignment**: Ensure the engine is properly aligned with the airframe's centerline to prevent vibration, stress concentrations, or even catastrophic failures.

3. **Secure the engine**: Use high-strength fasteners and ensure the engine is securely attached to the airframe. This includes bolts, nuts, and any other hardware used to retain the engine.

4. **Integrate cooling systems**: If your engine requires a cooling system (e.g., oil cooler or radiator), integrate it into the aircraft's cooling circuit. Ensure proper airflow and heat transfer to prevent overheating.

5. **Plan for fuel and ignition**: Consider the fuel system, including fuel tanks, pumps, filters, and lines. Also, ensure proper ignition system installation, including spark plugs, wires, and a starter.

6. **Protect against environmental factors**: Install covers or fairings to protect the engine from debris, weather conditions (e.g., snow, rain), and extreme temperatures.

7. **Electrical systems integration**: Integrate electrical systems like starters, generators, and avionics with the aircraft's wiring and electrical architecture.

8. **Propeller installation**: Ensure proper propeller installation, including alignment, pitch, and yaw. Consider the effects of air density, turbulence, and other environmental factors on propeller performance.

9. **Ground testing**: Perform thorough ground testing to verify engine operation, including checks for leaks, proper function, and acceptable vibration levels.

10. **Consult the plans and documentation**: Refer to your aircraft's plans, specifications, and manufacturer instructions for guidance on engine installation. These resources will help ensure a safe and efficient installation process.

Remember, it's essential to follow established procedures and guidelines when installing an engine in an amateur-built aircraft. If you're unsure about any aspect of the process, consult with experts or seek additional training to ensure a successful outcome.
