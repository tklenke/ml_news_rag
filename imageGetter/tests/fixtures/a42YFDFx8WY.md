 Dear Aliev, 


 


 At the moment I am not installing any kind of electronic ignition. Who knows in the future….

 Thanks for the interest on the just finish overhaul, please find below my answers:
 
 "Looks great. I'm assuming you found 2 chrome covers on ebay and waiting to find a bargain on 2 more."
 \-\-
 I did not get them on ebay, just made them all from standard covers. I hired a company named "Custom Chrome" having a good expertise on high quality Harley Davidson chrome parts. 
 If you notice, the screws on the covers are also structural stainless steel Harley Davidson hex screws.
 
 "What brand or type yellow paint did you use?"
 \-\-
 The paint type goes also very well linked with the preparation process, here it is:
 1\.\- Crankcase and oil sum, Metal pickling by immersion.
 2\.\- Once pickling finished, clean with hot water and immersion again with ultrasounds on cavitating liquid
 3\.\- Clean again and abrasion using almond shell.
 4\.\- Once all this done, phosphating 1k primer and let cure
 5\.\- After 48 hours, one layer of anticaloric paint under regulation UNE ISO 2811
 6\.\- Final layer (colour) with anticaloric paint under regulation UNE ISO 3679\. This paint is used in the brake package on some racing vehicles, bearing up to 800 Celsius.

 Last but not least, you will notice the orange spots on the upper part of the cylinders. The regulation also sets colours for the piston treatment type, not to mix different treatments by mistake. In my case, the treatment on the pistons is NikaSil.

 I hope this clarified your questions.

 Best regards,

 Agustin
