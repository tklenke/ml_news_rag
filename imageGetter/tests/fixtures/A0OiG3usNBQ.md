I won't even mention satellite Internet, Madza 13B, 3 front seats, floats... I know, I'm just getting silly.

I have never observed that effect at all. If there is any its small. Yes there is a trim change. Pretty sure lift and angle of attack considerations did not enter into Nat or Burts design criteria

The belly board may be considered a flat plate with, (in a very crude calculation) a centre of lift at about 1/4 chord. It was specifically positioned to minimise any trim change with the stated objective of increasing drag alone, not of changing deck angle or increasing lift. But at the time, it seemed to me that the designer might have had those objectives. Presumably the designer minimised trim effects by estimating where the centre of lift of the surface would be and positioning it appropriately. Some thought should be given to the possibility of trim changes from a radically different shape. As the surface produces lift when deployed (it does deflect air down), if that lift is in the right place for neutral trim effects, to maintain the same lift for the aeroplane as a whole, angle of attack and thus deck angle are inevitably reduced. But in consequence of meeting a different object, not by intent. The effects I described were evident on 55 knot approaches to land within 350 metres of ground roll, where, without the landing brake a steep deck angle was present making it difficult to see where you were going. In the case of the Varieze, that’s not the stated intent, which was to come in at Ca. 75 knots with a steeper descent than without the brake and with reduced the ground roll. At that time, I didn’t understand the effects of permeability on flat plates and incorrectly thought it increased drag \- it doesn’t. I was thinking about reducing the disturbance of flow to the airscrew, by reducing recirculation and turbulence behind the brake. More by chance than anything else, the six one inch dia. holes in the central area I contemplated would probably have done that without making much difference to drag or lift.
