 Does anyone have or sell wing leading edge molds 


 I’m at that stage and I haven’t been building
for 2 years now and im a bit skeptical of my abilities at this point

edge of the strakes was one of the easiest things I did in the whole building
process. You don't have to rely on artistic creativity to get the
shape you want. As long as the tip of each strake rib is shaped per
plans and all tips are aligned to mate with the wing rib tip (can use dental
floss to check this) then it's a simple matter of getting a sanding block
that is longer than the longest distance between any two ribs and just
sand away. If you use urethane as called out in the plans, it is
much softer than the strake rib tips so once the foam sands down to the
tip surface, you stop. If you're sanding block is long enough (mine
is 48") then you won't create a depression between the ribs.
